# What's in the Box?
!!!warning
    **You do not need to read everything in this section.** In fact, you might want to skip it entirely and 
    come back if you have questions about any specific file that was generated.

This section will outline everything generated by this project along with reasoning behind a lot of the choices. This 
section is intended more as a reference than anything else, read the stuff you're curious about, skip everything else.

A fully generated example (the same example included inline here) can be found in the "example" directory in the 
GitHub repo.

## Top Level
Whatever you provided for the [package_name] variable will be created as a directory. Inside will be a fully fledged 
Python package containing a [FastAPI] app and everything you need to deploy it to [AWS Lambda] using the [Serverless] framework.

In this top level directory you'll get all of the following:

### README.md
Describes how to build and deploy this freshly generated package. Also contains a link back to these docs for easy reference.

### [pyproject.toml](pyproject.md)
The single source of metadata for your project, as defined by [PEP-518]. This contains configuration for several tools 
used in building & testing your app.


[AWS Lambda]: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/
[package_name]: README.md#package_name
[PEP-518]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/
